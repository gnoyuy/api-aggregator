# api aggregator
platform for help api aggregate , finally migrate coding work to config work on this platform

# why need aggregator ?
why we need a aggregator platform ? here we give two reason
1. user experience.  network transport from client to server always slow, when some api depend other , client request 
 many times will cost a lot of time, however , if we aggregate all all api in one page , we can request all
 data just one time request, then the cost time will more less than the way request many times, because aggregate
 operate go through internal network and request fast between each other. less time cost advance user experience.
2. developer experience. aggregator always convenience for developer , help them high efficient on daily develop 
work , if we not have a aggregator, these aggregate work always do by developer, append with low efficient and repeat
